<b>Memoization</b> 
<br />is a term describing an optimization technique where you cache previously computed results, and return the cached result when the same computation is needed again.

<b>Dynamic programming</b> 
<br />a technique for solving problems recursively and is applicable when the computations of the subproblems overlap.

Dynamic programming is typically implemented using tabulation, but can also be implemented using memoization. So as you can see, neither one is a "subset" of the other.


<b>Pure Function</b>
<br />In computer programming, a function or expression is considered pure if its evaluation has no side effect, such as mutation of objects or output to I/O devices[1][2].

The output of a pure function may depend on an internal or external state, for instance on a local static variable or a global variable respectively, and thus its output may change according to the context. The important point is that the function itself does not change that state.
