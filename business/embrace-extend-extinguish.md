[Embrace Extend Extinguish](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Embrace,_extend_and_extinguish) - anti competitive strategy 

#Embrace: Development of software substantially compatible with a competing product, or implementing a public standard.
#Extend: Addition and promotion of features not supported by the competing product or part of the standard, creating interoperability problems for customers who try to use the 'simple' standard.
#Extinguish: When extensions become a de facto standard because of their dominant market share, they marginalize competitors that do not or cannot support the new extensions.
